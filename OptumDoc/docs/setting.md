# Setting

## airflow.cfg
The first time you run Airflow, it will create a file called **airflow.cfg** in your **$AIRFLOW_HOME** directory (~/airflow by default). This file contains Airflowâ€™s configuration and you can edit it to change any of the settings. You can also set options with environment variables by using this format: **AIRFLOW__{SECTION}__{KEY}** (note the double underscores).

For example, the metadata database connection string can either be set in airflow.cfg like this:
```
[database]
sql_alchemy_conn = my_conn_string
```
or by creating a corresponding environment variable:
```
export AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=my_conn_string
```
## Override airflow.cfg
The airflow.cfg comes from the default installation and stays unchanged. We can create a new configuration and create new environment variables in it to overwrite airflow.cfg  
1. Create a new configuration file in the same directory as airflow.cfg  
    ```
    $ touch afmui_airflow.cfg
    ```
2. Open and update airflow setup sh file (airtdp_env_setup.sh)
    ```
    $ vim airtdp_env_setup.sh
    ```
    Update source file in AIRFLOW CONFIGURATION section to afmui_airflow.cfg:
